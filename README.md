1) Sigmoid Function: This is a sort of mini neural network, a 2-layerd freeforward one. It relies on the Sigmoid Function to introduce non-linearity during learning. It also calculates error gradients (delta) during backpropagation, where the network how much each weight (number that controls how much influence one neuron has on a different one) contributes to the error and how much each one is to blame. During operation, this neural network learns the XOR logic function, which is something I encountered already during my studies learning about logic gates. 

IMPORTANT: Install numpy on PyCharm if you haven't already. For that, you go to terminal and type in 'pip install numpy'
