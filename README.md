# Python-Projects

You can find some AI-Related projects here in this repository. New projects will be added, and this file will be updated accordingly.

1) Chatbot V1: This is a very simple chatbot, which implements the basic concepts of artificial intelligence. It doesn't learn during the usage, but it receives user input as well as recognizes user's goal and tries to find the best possible output, which are fundamental parts of AI. This uploaded chatbot was programmed some time ago, so it might be a bit outdated.

2) Sigmoid Function: This is a sort of mini neural network, a 2-layerd freeforward one. It relies on the Sigmoid Function to introduce non-linearity during learning. It also calculates error gradients (delta) during backpropagation, where the network how much each weight (number that controls how much influence one neuron has on a different one) contributes to the error and how much each one is to blame. During operation, this neural network learns the XOR logic function, which is something I encountered already during my studies learning about logic gates. 

IMPORTANT: Install numpy on PyCharm if you haven't already. For that, you go to terminal and type in 'pip install numpy'
